1) Install MyColorPicker extension (git@github.com:ThinkCreative/MyColorPicker.git)
2) check (and reset if needed) extension file permissions, clear caches, regenerate autoloads.
3) install from site admin package interface the tc_calendar and event classes (replace existing event) by importing package file tc_calendar_and_event-1.0-1.ezpkg (found in packages dir in this extension. You will need to copy this file only your local machine before import.)
4) create settings/override/tccalendar.ini.append.php file (use tccalendar.ini file in this extension as a guide - fill in correct class info etc)
5) activate extension by adding setting in settings/override/site.ini.append.php
6) if your main siteaccess is not called site, you will need to create a symlink like the one that already exists in extension/tccalendar/settings/siteaccess that matches your siteaccess name and points to the chp dir.
7) check (and reset if needed) extension file permissions, clear caches, regenerate autoloads.

You should be now able to create tc_calendar objects, and event sub-items, and have the correct templates display them in the full view of your site.
